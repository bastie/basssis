    <p>This is a simple SSI server written in Rust. Why Rust? Because I do not need too much dependencies on my target system to build and compile. Why new server? Because I need not so much but I need some more.</p>
    <h2>Supported features</h2>
    <p>It supports the GET command from HTTP.</p>
    <p>It supports the #exec command from SSi. On (Free)BSD and other systems for example you see the OS nformation with command <tt>/usr/bin/uname -a</tt>:<br/> 
    <!--#exec cmd = "/usr/bin/uname -a" -->
    <h2>Configuration</h2>
    <p>The server need a program named "get_IP", with x flag on BSD. This PRG need to print the binding IP, not port, on CLI.</p>
